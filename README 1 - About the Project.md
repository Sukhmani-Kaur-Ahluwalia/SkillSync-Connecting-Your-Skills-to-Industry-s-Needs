Our project synchronizes student's interests and skills with industry needs.
In this way, students will contribute to the country's economy and production sector.
This approach makes the students aware of the skills needed by the industry, so that they learn the needed skills.
It removes all the middlemen that create problems in conveying industrial need of skills to students such as professors/people who are not updated with the latest information, people spreading rumours and wrong information on YouTube and lack of interaction between educational institutions and industry leaders.
The student creates his profile and it shows all jobs match (in %), according to his skills.
It even tells what all skills the student needs to learn so as to match 100% for a particular job and gives resources for the same.
It also allows the industry to post job openings and skills required for that position. (This feature will be available in round 2).
